The rapper has made no secret of how much he enjoys cannabis and has long since embraced it as part of his professional image too. However, despite Snoop Dogg’s love for smoking weed, even he admits he isn’t the best to ever do it. In fact, Willie Nelson even managed to beat him in dominoes while they were smoking together. In a 2018 interview on The Howard Stern Show , Snoop Dogg opened up about his personal and professional lives. And naturally, the conversation turned toward the rapper’s use of cannabis, which led to Snoop Dogg’s revelation that Nelson is by far the “greatest smoker” he’s ever seen, a claim he previously made on Twitter in 2009. “That fact remains true to this day,” Snoop Dogg told Howard Stern. Given their mutual love for smoking weed, it’s no wonder the rapper hit it off with Nelson when they met. In fact, Snoop Dogg told Stern in 2018 that he and Nelson both wound up in Amsterdam at the same time one year, right around April 20, aka 420 , the annual day in which cannabis users celebrate the substance and the lifestyle tied to it. Although Snoop Dogg remains in awe of Nelson’s ability to keep sharp through all that, the country singer has since given up smoking weed, according to Entertainment Tonight Canada . Due to health reasons, he has switched to a vaporizer, allowing him to safeguard his lungs and continue his music career well into his late 80s. Snoop Dogg also admitted to Stern he isn’t smoking nearly as much as he used to. After all, the rapper is wildly busy even after nearly three decades in the spotlight. In addition to putting out his nineteenth studio album in 2022, Snoop Dogg has another one – a follow-up to his debut, Doggystyle , titled Missionary – in the works, with Dr. Dre once again producing. And most surprisingly, Snoop Dogg also launched a YouTube channel for preschool children. On Doggyland, the rapper voices the lead character called Bow Wizzle on the web series, which focuses on merging childhood education with music and nursery rhymes. “You can just be you and be accepted in Doggyland, and that’s what these characters represent, diversity so that kids can learn to love each other from the beginning because hate is what’s taught, love is what’s in their heart,” Snoop Dogg said in a video announcing the project .

The company is heralding the invention as a breakthrough that could make medical cannabis cheaper and more environmentally friendly as well, since it doesn't need nearly as much water or any fertilizer at all. \"We don’t grow the plant at all,\" BioHarvest CEO Ilan Sobel told The Times of Israel, explaining that cells from the hemp plant are cultivated inside massive bioreactors in a lab. The process is surprisingly quick as well. \"We grow them in huge bioreactors in just three weeks — while regular cannabis takes 14 to 23 weeks,\" he added. \"Our tech can also significantly increase the levels of active ingredients, as a percent of the weight, versus what is found normally in the plant.\" In other words, the resulting THC substance can be extremely potent — but it doesn't necessarily have to be. \"By adjusting specific conditions to which the cells are exposed, we can create different desired compositions of active ingredients, meaning we can dial up and down the various cannabinoids [compounds],\" Sobel told the newspaper. The substance also doesn't require any genetic modification and perfectly replicates all the CBD, THC, and \"minor cannabinoid\" compounds found in naturally grown weed, he said. According to BioHarvest's calculations, it only needs one gallon of water to produce the same amount of material that it'd take 54 gallons to grow in plant form — and in 90 percent less space. So what's the drawback? While the company has applied for licenses to sell its product in both the US and Israel for medical purposes, it will likely be a long and drawn-out process. Then there's the question if people will actually be open to try it. BioHarvest claims its substance can be smoked, taken in pill or drop form, or used in chewing gum — but that's not a guarantee that consumers will embrace the new option. Nonetheless, it's a fascinating look at a burgeoning industry. BioHarvest is even planning to test its products out in outer space , after partnering with retired Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield. Perhaps one day, space travelers will be able to still enjoy some recreational marijuana — without the need of maintaining an entire orbital greenhouse.

She was diagnosed with glioblastoma, an incurable, aggressive brain cancer more common among older men. Thukral is prepared to beat the odds and her experience has influenced her career goals as a vet. First, Sunny Thukral's grandfather died when she wasn't by his side. \"That hit me really hard,\" the 26-year-old said.Then, she began her final year at UC Davis Veterinary School, which has been ranked No. 1 in the world. \"I was insanely stressed because I wanted to do a good job,\" she said. Around the same time, Thukral went through a breakup — another \"cherry on top\" of her accumulating emotional load, she said. So when Thukral developed increasingly intense headaches in spring 2022 and began tripping over even the simplest calculations in school, she thought it was a physical manifestation of her grief and stress. \"Maybe I just need some migraine medication,\" Thukral thought. By this point, about a month after her symptoms began, Tylenol wasn't cutting it.But when she arrived at urgent care crying from pain and confusion, clinicians didn't give her medication. They gave her a CT scan and, soon after, began preparing a hospital bed.Within 48 hours, she was diagnosed with stage 4 glioblastoma, an aggressive and incurable brain cancer, and told most people with the disease only live a couple years.  \"Holy shit, I'm going to die tomorrow,\" she thought. \"Tell everyone you love them.\" Now, more than five months later, Thukral is exceeding doctors' expectations. She shared her story with Insider to advocate for brain cancer research funding, and to encourage people not to accept a bleak prognosis as fate. Thukral had surgery to remove most of the tumor Thukral's parents traveled to Davis when she was first hospitalized and took her back to LA, their hometown, for treatment. \"I don't think I let go of my parents' hands for, like, weeks,\" Thukral said. In LA, Thukral's aunt, a radiology specialist, connected her with a UCLA neurosurgeon.Thukral appreciated that the doctor spoke to her like the aspiring medical professional she is, and chose him to operate. The doctor removed most of Thukral's tumor in June. If he'd removed it all, Thukral would have lost her right-side motor function. Then, Thukral completed six weeks of radiotherapy, which came with side effects including hair loss. Sunny Thukral couldn't have all of her brain tumor removed in surgery without compromising her functioning.Sunny ThukralAlong the way, Thukral documented her experience as on TikTok and accrued more than 25,000 followers. \"It was complete and absolute shock in the very beginning\" that her story, and morbid humor, resonated with people, she said.Thukral also said posting about her personal life on social media is uncharacteristic, and that many of her initial posts were likely fueled by mania, a side effect of the steroids she was on to tame brain inflammation. \"I was like, 'Wow, I'm getting all this attention for something terrible that's happening. I'm gonna keep posting about it. It makes me feel better,'\" Thukral said. \"My brain was working a million miles a minute.\" While she's now off steroids and no longer posts frequently, Thukral said she doesn't regret sharing her story since she's connected with other young people in similar situations. Most patients with glioblastoma are older men Glioblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor, affecting just over 3 people out of every 100,000, according to the American Association of Neurological Surgeons.Symptoms can include persistent headaches, vision changes, difficulty speaking, loss of appetite, and mood changes. The average age of diagnosis is 64 years old, according to AANS, and most patients are men. Doctors don't know why some people develop glioblastoma, but some hereditary conditions like Lynch syndrome can raise the risk.\"Why did I get put in this box?\" Thukral sometimes thinks. She's never had a serious health issue before. About 40% of people with glioblastoma survive the first year of diagnosis, and only 17% make it through the second year. The way the cancer embeds itself into nearby brain tissue is one reason it's so difficult to treat.  \"Brain cancer is one of the most underfunded types of cancer,\" Thukral said. \"And there are no cures to the type of cancer I have.\"  But she's determined to beat the odds, and says her doctors suspect she will, given her age.\"If you are given a diagnosis and a prognosis that you don't like to hear, don't listen,\" Thukral said. \"I'm not living my life on a timeline of two, three, four years. I am expecting to still get married. I'm going to have kids. I'm going to watch them grow up. I'm going to manifest that to happen.\" Thukral's tumor continues to shrink These days, Thukral is on monthly oral chemotherapy, and trying a range of complementary treatments, including herbal supplements and cannabis. At Thukral's latest brain scan, her oncologist told her to keep doing what she's doing because her tumor continues to shrink. \"I don't know what's working and I don't know what's overkill, but as long as things are still going well, I'm gonna stick with everything I've got,\" Thukral said. Sunny Thukral post-diagnosis with her veterinary school classmatesSunny ThukralHer main symptoms of living with what's left of the tumor are cognitive — she sometimes loses her train of thought or stumbles over words. She's taking a break from school until her linear thinking becomes more reliable, something she's working to improve with practice and brain supplements like those made from mushrooms.But Thukral is determined to return — and focus on at-home euthanasia services to help families putting down pets in pain. She wants to make it a \"comfortable, loving environment instead of a scary one.\" \"This experience has definitely gotten me to be more in touch with the concept of death,\" she said, \"and what I would want, and what I feel like my dog would want when she passes, and what my grandfather wanted when he passed.\" Read the original article on Insider","pubDate":"2022-10-26 17:13:59","image_url":"https://i.insider.com/6356a6ceffcac3001876ebf4?format=jpeg","source_id":"insider","country":["united states of america"],"category":["top"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Brittney Griner called her Russian detainment 'very traumatic' in her latest appearance from behind bars","link":"https://www.insider.com/brittney-griner-russia-prison-traumatic-court-appeal-video-2022-10","keywords":["Sports","News","Brittney Griner","WNBA","Women's Sports","Russia","Detainee","Trial","Court","Sports","SportsOriginalReporting"],"creator":["insider@insider.com (Meredith Cash)"],"video_url":null,"description":"Peering through the bars of a prison cell, Brittney Griner described her emotional struggle, apologized for her missteps, and pleaded for leniency.","content":"Brittney Griner appears at her Russian appeal hearing via video call.REUTERS/Evgenia Novozhenina Brittney Griner made her first public appearance in months during her appeal hearing Tuesday.

Griner called her incarceration \"very traumatic\" and asked for leniency, but her appeal was denied. Brittney Griner made her first public appearance since August during her appeal hearing Tuesday.The WNBA superstar appeared over a video call in a courthouse in the Moscow Region of Russia to speak with the panel of judges considering her case.

I did not intend to do this, but I understand the charges brought against me, and I just hope that that is also taken into account.\"But instead of showing mercy, the judges made Griner's worst nightmares a reality; the courts upheld her initial nine-year sentence that everyone from fellow prominent sports figures to US President Joe Biden deemed \"unacceptable.\" The eight-time WNBA All-Star was first arrested in February, when agents at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport found vape cartridges containing less than a gram of cannabis oil in her luggage. She's been incarcerated near the capital city ever since.But now that her appeal has officially been denied, she's likely to face even harsher living conditions in one of Russia's infamous penal colonies, where abuse, disease, and neglect often run rampant. In addition to the fact that Griner will almost certainly become a target in prison as an American national — and a famous one, at that — those close to the two-time Olympic gold medalist have begun to express concerns about her declining mental fortitude.The 6-foot-9 Phoenix Mercury center's lawyer, Maria Blagovolina, echoed similar sentiments after Tuesday's hearing. When a reporter commented that Griner looked \"really, really doomed today — more than she was previously,\" the Russian attorney offered a simple explanation:\"Because she had some hopes,\" Blagovolina said. \"And those hopes vanished today.\" Griner's only remaining path for an expedient return to the States would involve a prisoner exchange between the US and Russia. Though the White House has reportedly offered to swap notorious Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout for the return of Griner and fellow American Paul Whelan, US government officials have maintained that they have yet to receive a serious counteroffer out of Moscow.Still, Wasserman's Lindsay Colas, who has been Griner's agent since she first began playing professional basketball, implored the government to act \"with urgency\" to bring the star home.\"The fire at Evin prison in Iran last week that almost killed American prisoner Emad Shargi, and Matthew Heath's attempt to take his life in June while held in Venezuela, prove that time is an illusion,\" Colas said in a statement provided to Insider. \"We do not have time.\"Griner appears virtually at an appeal hearing.REUTERS/Evgenia Novozhenina\"At any moment something might happen, and we must remain focused and unified in our call to return BG to her family immediately,\" she added.President Joe Biden said Tuesday that he and White House staffers have been \"in constant contact with Russian authorities\" in an effort to reach a deal to bring the basketball superstar back stateside.\"We've not been meeting with much positive response,\" Biden added. \"But we're not stopping.\"Read the original article on Insider","pubDate":"2022-10-26 16:33:18","image_url":"https://i.insider.com/635946b6fc29ff001a5f7e6e?format=jpeg","source_id":"insider","country":["united states of america"],"category":["top"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Brittney Griner Towers Over Former WWE World Heavyweight Champion in Rare Picture","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/wwe-nba-news-brittney-griner-towers-over-former-wwe-world-heavyweight-champion-in-rare-picture/","keywords":["Basketball","Wrestling","Bella Twins","Brie Bella","Brittney Griner","Daniel Bryan","mark henry","Nikki Bella"],"creator":["Archie Blade"],"video_url":null,"description":"US Women’s basketball star Brittney Griner towers over former WWE World Heavyweight Champion in a rare unearthed picture.

A Russian court on Tuesday rejected Griner’s appeal against her nine-year prison sentence for drug possession. The eight-time all-star center with the WNBA’s Phoenix Mercury and a two-time Olympic gold medalist was convicted Aug. 4 after police said they found vape canisters containing cannabis oil in her luggage at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport. Asked if Griner could be freed as part of a prisoners swap with Washington, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a conference call with reporters that “we always say that any contacts about possible exchanges can only be conducted in silence under a tight lid on any information.” Griner’s arrest in February came at a time of heightened tensions between Moscow and Washington, just days before Russia sent troops into Ukraine. At the time, Griner was returning to play for a Russian team during the WNBA’s offseason. President Joe Biden told reporters that his administration is in “constant contact” with Russian authorities on Griner and other Americans who are detained there. While there has not been progress on bringing her back to the U.S., Biden said, “We’re not stopping.” At her trial, Griner admitted to having the canisters in her luggage but testified she packed them inadvertently in her haste to make her flight and had no criminal intent. Her defense team presented written statements saying she had been prescribed cannabis to treat chronic pain. Before her conviction, the U.S. State Department declared Griner to be “wrongfully detained” — a charge that Russia has sharply rejected. U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said in a statement that Biden “is willing to go to extraordinary lengths and make tough decisions to bring Americans home.” In July, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in an unusual step that Washington had made a “substantial proposal” to Moscow get Griner home, along with Paul Whelan, an American serving a 16-year sentence in Russia for espionage. He didn’t elaborate, but The Associated Press and other news organizations have reported that Washington has offered to exchange Griner and Whelan for Viktor Bout, a Russian arms dealer who is serving a 25-year sentence in the U.S. and once earned the nickname the “merchant of death.”","pubDate":"2022-10-26 14:19:03","image_url":null,"source_id":"wcpo","country":["united states of america"],"category":["top"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Germany Moves To Legalize Cannabis—Would Be Largest European Country To Do So","link":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthart/2022/10/26/germany-moves-to-legalize-cannabis-would-be-largest-european-country-to-do-so/","keywords":["Business","/business","Business","/business","Innovation","/innovation","Healthcare","/healthcare","Lifestyle","/lifestyle","Vices","/vices","Breaking","breaking-news"],"creator":["Robert Hart"," Forbes Staff"],"video_url":null,"description":"Health minister Karl Lauterbach said Germany’s government-regulated model could serve as an example for the whole of Europe, where only a few countries have decriminalized cannabis and only one, Malta, has legalized it.","content":"Health minister Karl Lauterbach said Germany’s government-regulated model could serve as an example for the whole of Europe, where only a few countries have decriminalized cannabis and only one, Malta, has legalized it.","pubDate":"2022-10-26 12:14:09","image_url":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/635921e98adf50527e3671f5/0x0.jpg?width=960&precrop=3586%2C2018%2Cx0%2Cy218","source_id":"forbes","country":["united states of america"],"category":["technology"],"language":"english"}],"nextPage":1}
